Patna, the capital of Bihar, India, has a history that spans at least 3,000 years and is associated with two of the world's oldest religions, Buddhism and Jainism.
 The city was founded in 490 BCE by the king of Magadha and was known as Pataliputra. 
It was the capital of the Magadha Empire for many dynasties, including the Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, Gupta, and Pala.
 Pataliputra was a center of learning and the fine arts, and archaeological excavations have shown that 
it dominated the political fortunes of north India from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD. 
However, the city declined and was deserted by the 7th century. 
In 1541, an Afghan ruler refounded the city as Patna and it rose to prosperity under the Mughal Empire.
 In 1603, Sher Shah Suri moved the capital from Biharsharif to Patna and returned the city to its former glory. 
In 1703, Prince Azim-us-Shan, the grandson of Aurangzeb, became the governor of Patna and tried to make it a beautiful city,
 giving it the name "Azimabad". However, the common people continued to call it "Patna". 
In 1765, the city passed to the British, who built a modern extension called Bankipore. 
Mahatma Gandhi held prayer meetings in Gandhi Maidan in this area.
